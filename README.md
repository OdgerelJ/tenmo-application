# tenmo-application

Tenmo Payment System: Worked as a team using RESTful API server and command-line 
application. It was a part of pair programming taken place at Tech Elevator coding bootcamp.
I was paired with Rebecca Palmore for this assignment. We have built command line java program
for both client and server side.
